## Course Description

This course provides an in-depth exploration of how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology enhances cybersecurity. Gain a thorough understanding of RAGâ€™s core components, including how it integrates with large language models to enhance data retrieval and analysis. The course focuses on practical use cases such as mapping cyber security logs and alerts to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, performing real-time gap analysis for governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) Join instructor Brennan Lodge to gain the knowledge and tools to implement RAG solutions, improving both proactive defense strategies and compliance processes in their organizations. This course is ideal for cybersecurity professionals, GRC experts, and data scientists seeking to leverage AI-driven solutions for enhanced security operations.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
